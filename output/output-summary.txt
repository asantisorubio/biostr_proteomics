In this project, I conducted an initial analysis of mass spectrometry data derived from a 
human study available in the PRIDE database. I assessed the confidence of peptide matches using 
3 different approaches, obtaining different results:

Number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) with FDR or q value < 0.01:
	- Manual estimation of FDR -> 151
	- Assign-confidence -> 138
	- Percolator -> 328
	
Contrary to my initial expectations, Percolator appears to be the least restrictive algorithm. 
It is important to highlight this because as the most complex approach, it is able to separate 
target from decoy PSMs based on machine-learning methods. 

On the other hand, the number of significant PSMs using the assign-confidence algorithm and 
calculating the FDR manually is very similar. This is reasonable given that both approaches rely 
on target/decoy competition (TDC) for assessing the confidence.

A plausible explanation for these results could be that it is not strictly necessary to obtain 
always a lower number of significant PSMs using a more sophisticated algorithm. In fact, it also 
depends on the quality and the amount of data included in the analysis. In this case, I have 
used the data from only 3 files of the study, whose main objective was identifying 
potential biomarkers of bladder cancer through LC-MS/MS of urine samples. Probably if I had 
included more files, the results would be closer to what is expected.

Finally, it is noteworthy that despite the varying outcomes, the results seem to be consistent 
as they are in the range of 100-400 PSMs with FDR < 0.01 from a list of 378641 total hits 
(190083 targets).
